    "As this is an example and not an actual experiment data was generated using simplified equations for demonstration purposes. One set of data was designed to model a year of growth outside with seasonal variations. The second set was designed to model a traditional laboratory growth experiment. For both datasets the models were multiplied by and random 80% to 120% factor to add some variability.\n",

The equation used is below as reference. Because it a simply equation the calculated values will make examples of statistical analysis simplified compared to real world data. Below is the equation:\n",
